## Submission Instructions

### Overview
I have decided to do a personal budgeting web application. This application can be modified for business use if a client so desires. The application will track spending from various budget categories (Rent, utilities, food, gas, bills, etc.). Each month, the user will create a new budget, and initialize dollar amounts to each category. As the month goes on, the user can enter transactions and deduct a specified amount from a category per transaction. Users can also specify a minimum ammount for each category when the remaining balance in each cateogory is considered low. The app will also display spending in a pie chart and will also be able to generate a transaction report to show what transactions have been entered into the system for that month.

Users will find the application most beneficial for its ease and simplicity of use. The user interface will be user friendly and users will be able to enter transactions, track their spending, and monitor their financial health quickly and easily.

I got this idea when using my own bank's app and saw how clustered and un-friendly the user interface was. There were also features there that they average bank customer would not use (such as advanced analytics and investment features).

### Features
**1. Create new monthly budget** - Create a new monthly budget, add budget categories, and set initial balances for each category.

**2. Enter transactions** - Transactions entered would be deducted from the appropriate category's balance by the transaction amount.

**3. Chart spending** - Generate a pie graph of spending for the current month.

**4. Generate reports** - Generate transaction reports, print-friendly budget report

### Technologies
Spring MVC, Spring Security, CanvasJS, Bootstrap CSS, MySQL, PHP, Thymeleaf
